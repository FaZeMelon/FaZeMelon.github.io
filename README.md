# FaZeMelon.github.io
Synopsis

This page is mainly for the testing of my HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and other languages to improve my skills, and to show I'm not a complete noob.

Motivation

As the synopsis says, I created this site to test my skills and to prove they are real. I found out about the github.io pages a bit ago, and started actually coding it recently
